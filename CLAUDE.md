# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Tool Usage Rules — Always Follow

### Code Analysis
- ALWAYS use LSP tools for code analysis, diagnostics, type checking, and symbol resolution.
- Never guess at types, definitions, or errors when LSP tools are available. Use them first.

### Web Search
- ALWAYS use Firecrawl for any web search, URL fetching, or documentation lookup.
- Do not use generic Bash curl/wget for web content retrieval if Firecrawl is available.

### Git Operations
- ALWAYS use git-mcp for any git operations: commits, diffs, logs, branches, status, etc.
- Do not fall back to raw `git` Bash commands unless git-mcp explicitly fails.

## Environment & Installation Rules

### Never install directly on the host system
- If ANY task requires installing packages, runtimes, compilers, dependencies, or system tools,
  ALWAYS assume the work should happen inside a container (Docker or similar).
- Do NOT run `apt install`, `brew install`, `npm install -g`, `pip install` (system-wide),
  or any other system-level installation directly on the host machine.
- Instead: automatically propose a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml that covers the requirement,
  and wait for approval before proceeding.
- This applies even if the install command looks harmless or temporary.
- When in doubt, ask "should this go in a container?" — the default answer is YES.

### Detect and respect existing container setup
- At the start of any task, check if a Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, or .dockerignore
  exists in the repo root or any parent directory.
- If found AND the task involves running, building, installing, or testing anything:
  STOP and ask before proceeding.
- Do not assume the answer is yes automatically — always ask explicitly, every time.
- Only proceed after receiving a clear answer.
- If the answer is yes: all commands, builds, installs, and test runs must happen
  inside that container, not on the host.

These are standing instructions. Do not wait to be reminded. Apply them every session.
